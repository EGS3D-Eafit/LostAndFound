# Lost&Found

üó∫Ô∏èProject Description

New and visiting students at Universidad EAFIT often face difficulties navigating the campus, especially when they are unfamiliar with its buildings and layout. Getting lost not only wastes time but also generates stress, particularly when students need to arrive on time to classes or meetings.

Lost&Found is a proposed web-based and mobile-accessible platform designed to help people navigate the EAFIT campus. Instead of depending only on static maps or external apps, Lost&Found provides personalized navigation, location-based assistance, and augmented reality guidance, giving users a seamless wayfinding experience.
